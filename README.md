# Dynamic-Memory-Networks-in-TensorFlow
Dynamic Memory Network implementation in TensorFlow

Structure and parameters from https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01417 "Dynamic Memory Networks for Visual and Textual Question Answering".

Adapted from Stanford's cs224d RNN assignment 2 starter code and using methods from https://github.com/YerevaNN/Dynamic-memory-networks-in-Theano for importing the Babi-10k dataset.
