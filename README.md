# Dynamic-Memory-Networks-in-TensorFlow
DMN+ implementation in TensorFlow

Structure and parameters from https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01417 "Dynamic Memory Networks for Visual and Textual Question Answering".

Adapted from Stanford's cs224d assignment 2 starter code (http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) and using methods from https://github.com/YerevaNN/Dynamic-memory-networks-in-Theano for importing the Babi-10k dataset.
